## 📝 Before Pushing

### 1. Configure Git Identity (If Not Done)

```bash
# Set your email
git config user.email "akashthanda14@gmail.com"

# Set your name
git config user.name "Akash Thanda"

# Or set globally
git config --global user.email "akashthanda14@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "Akash Thanda"
```

### 2. Verify Your Commits

```bash
# View all commits
git log --oneline

# View detailed log
git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset'

# Check what will be pushed
git log origin/main..main --oneline
```

---

## 🚀 Pushing to Remote

### Option 1: Standard Push (Recommended)

```bash
# Push all commits to main branch
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Force Push (If Needed)

⚠️ **Warning:** Only use if you're sure no one else is working on this branch!

```bash
# Force push (overwrites remote history)
git push origin main --force

# Safer force push (fails if remote has new commits)
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

### Option 3: Push and Set Upstream

```bash
# Push and set upstream tracking
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 🔍 Verify Push Success

After pushing, verify on GitHub:

```bash
# View remote status
git remote -v

# Check if push was successful
git log origin/main..main

# If no output, push was successful!
```

Visit your GitHub repository:

## 🔄 Common Push Scenarios

### Scenario 1: First Time Push
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Scenario 2: Remote Has Changes
```bash
# Fetch remote changes
git fetch origin

# Rebase your commits on top
git rebase origin/main

# Push
git push origin main
```

### Scenario 3: Conflicting History
```bash
# If you're sure your local version is correct
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

### Scenario 4: Push Failed
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Check remote
git remote -v

# Try again
git push origin main -v
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Error: "Updates were rejected"
```bash
# Option 1: Pull and merge
git pull origin main --no-rebase
git push origin main

# Option 2: Force push (careful!)
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

### Error: "Permission denied"
```bash
# Check SSH key
ssh -T git@github.com

# Or use HTTPS with token
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/akashthanda14/edtechpunjab.git
```

### Error: "Failed to push some refs"
```bash
# Fetch and check
git fetch origin
git status

# Force push if needed
git push origin main --force
