# ✅ Switched to OTP Route - Cost Optimization Complete

## Changes Made

### 🔄 Route Migration

**BEFORE (Quick Route - ₹5.00/SMS):**
```javascript
route: 'q',  // Quick route
message: `Your OTP is ${otp}...`,  // Custom message
// Cost: ₹5.00 per SMS
```

**AFTER (OTP Route - ₹0.15/SMS):**
```javascript
route: 'otp',  // OTP route
variables_values: otp.toString(),  // Just OTP number
// Cost: ₹0.15 per SMS (once verified)
```

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### File Updates

1. **services/smsService.js** (Updated)
   - Changed `route: 'q'` → `route: 'otp'`
   - Changed `message` → `variables_values`
   - Added verification error handling (Error 996)
   - Added dev mode fallback (logs OTP when verification pending)
   - Changed custom SMS to use transactional route (₹0.25)
   - Disabled flash SMS (prevents ₹5.00 charges)
   - Added cost tracking in logs

2. **services/smsService-quickroute-backup.js** (Backup)
   - Original Quick route version preserved
   - For reference only

### Message Format Changes

**OTP Route Message** (Predefined by Fast2SMS):
```
Your OTP: 123456
```

**Custom SMS** (Transactional Route):
```
Your custom message here
```

### Development Mode Behavior

When verification is pending (Error 996):
```javascript
// In development mode
console.log(`📱 [DEV MODE - VERIFICATION PENDING] SMS OTP for +916239562383: 123456`);

// Returns success with OTP logged
return { 
  success: true, 
  otp: '123456',
  pendingVerification: true 
};
```

This ensures:
- Development continues smoothly
- OTPs are accessible in console
- Production code ready for when verification completes
