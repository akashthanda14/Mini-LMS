# ✅ Auth & RBAC Implementation - Complete

## 🎯 Objective

Implement JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (RBAC) for the MicroCourses LMS platform, supporting three user roles: LEARNER, CREATOR, and ADMIN.

---

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. Update Auth Controllers ✅
- [x] Default role set to LEARNER for new registrations
- [x] POST /auth/login returns JWT with role claim
- [x] GET /auth/me returns current user with role
- [x] Updated token generation to include userId, email, and role

### 2. Create RBAC Middleware Guards ✅
- [x] **requireLearner** - Allows LEARNER, CREATOR, ADMIN
- [x] **requireCreator** - Allows only CREATOR, ADMIN  
- [x] **requireAdmin** - Allows only ADMIN
- [x] **requireRole** - Flexible custom role checking

### 3. Update JWT Payload ✅
- [x] Include userId in JWT
- [x] Include role in JWT
- [x] Include email in JWT
- [x] Set purpose to "authentication"
- [x] 7-day expiration

### 4. Password Security ✅
- [x] Bcrypt password hashing (12 salt rounds)
- [x] Password validation maintained
- [x] Secure password comparison

### 5. Auth Middleware Updates ✅
- [x] Compatible with new LEARNER/CREATOR/ADMIN roles
- [x] Token verification extracts role
- [x] User object includes role in req.user

## ✅ Checkpoint Verification

All checkpoints passed! 🎉

| Checkpoint | Status | Details |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Register as learner succeeds, role defaults to LEARNER | ✅ | New users automatically get LEARNER role |
| Login returns JWT with correct role claim | ✅ | JWT includes userId, email, and role |
| Middleware correctly blocks/allows based on role | ✅ | All RBAC guards implemented and tested |
| /auth/me returns user with new role format | ✅ | Returns complete user profile with role |

## 🔑 Key Features Implemented

### JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "userId": "uuid",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "role": "LEARNER",
  "purpose": "authentication",
  "iat": 1759576537,
  "exp": 1760181337
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Public Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `POST /api/auth/verify-email` - Verify email OTP
- `POST /api/auth/verify-phone` - Verify phone OTP
- `POST /api/auth/complete-profile` - Complete user profile

#### Protected Endpoints
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh JWT token

### Role Hierarchy
```
ADMIN (Full Access)
  ↓
CREATOR (Course Management + Learner Access)
  ↓
LEARNER (Basic Learning Access)
```

---

## 🎭 User Roles

| Role | Description | Default? |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **LEARNER** | Browse courses, enroll, learn, earn certificates | ✅ Yes |
| **CREATOR** | Create courses, manage content, all learner permissions | No |
| **ADMIN** | Manage platform, approve creators, publish courses | No |

---

## 🛡️ RBAC Middleware Usage

### Example 1: All Users
```javascript
router.get('/courses', ensureAuth, requireLearner, getCourses);
```

### Example 2: Creators Only
```javascript
router.post('/courses', ensureAuth, requireCreator, createCourse);
```

### Example 3: Admins Only
```javascript
router.post('/applications/:id/approve', ensureAuth, requireAdmin, approveApp);
```

### Example 4: Custom Roles
```javascript
router.put('/courses/:id', ensureAuth, requireRole(['CREATOR', 'ADMIN']), updateCourse);
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
node test-auth-rbac.js
```

### Test Accounts
| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| ADMIN | admin@microcourses.com | password123 |
| LEARNER | john@example.com | password123 |
| CREATOR | sarah@example.com | password123 |

### Manual Testing
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"emailOrPhone":"john@example.com","password":"password123"}'

# Get current user
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/auth/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
