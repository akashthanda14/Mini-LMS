## 🎨 Schema Highlights

### Key Relationships
```
User ←→ CreatorApplication (1:1)
User ←→ Course (1:N as creator)
User ←→ Enrollment (1:N as learner)
Course ←→ Lesson (1:N)
Enrollment ←→ LessonProgress (1:N)
Enrollment ←→ Certificate (1:1)
```

### Unique Constraints
- One creator application per user
- One enrollment per user per course
- One progress record per enrollment per lesson
- Unique lesson order per course
- Unique certificate serial hash

### Cascade Deletes
- Delete user → removes all OTPs, enrollments, certificates
- Delete course → removes lessons, enrollments, certificates
- Delete enrollment → removes progress records
