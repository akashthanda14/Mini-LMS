## 🔄 Complete Workflow

```
1. LEARNER registers → Default role: LEARNER ✅
2. LEARNER submits application → Status: PENDING ✅
3. ADMIN views pending applications ✅
4. ADMIN approves application → Status: APPROVED ✅
5. User role upgraded: LEARNER → CREATOR ✅
6. CREATOR logs in with new token (role: CREATOR) ✅
7. CREATOR accesses dashboard ✅
8. CREATOR can create courses (future feature) ⏳
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### Transaction Safety
The approval process uses Prisma transactions to ensure:
1. User role update happens first
2. Application status update includes updated role
3. Both operations succeed or both fail (atomic)

### Role-Based Access Control
- Leverages existing RBAC middleware
- Seamless integration with auth system
- JWT tokens automatically include role claims

### Error Handling
- Specific error messages for each scenario
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error messages
