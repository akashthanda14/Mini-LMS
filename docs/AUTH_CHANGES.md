# Authentication Routes and API Updates

This document describes the recent changes to the authentication system to improve security and consistency.

## Key Changes

1. **Secure Profile Completion**:
   - Instead of exposing user IDs, we now use a secure `profileToken` for profile completion.
   - The token is short-lived (1 hour) and specific to profile completion.
   - Verification endpoints return this token instead of userId.

2. **Fixed JWT Generation**:
   - Fixed issue in `verifyPhoneOtp` where an undefined function `issueJwt` was being used.
   - Now using `createAuthToken` consistently across all endpoints.

3. **Route Path Consolidation**:
   - All authentication routes are now consistently under `/api/auth/*` prefix.
   - Updated documentation to reflect actual route paths.

4. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Added comprehensive documentation for all endpoints.
   - Added detailed explanations for security-critical operations.
   - Created new documentation for profile completion flow.

5. **Resend OTP Support**:
   - Documentation now references both dedicated endpoint and re-registration.

## New Token System

The profile completion system now uses a secure token flow:

1. **Registration**: User registers with email/phone
2. **Verification**: After OTP verification, user receives a `profileToken`
3. **Profile Completion**: User completes profile using the token
4. **Authentication**: User receives a JWT for ongoing authentication

This improves security by ensuring only the verified user can complete their profile.

## API Interface Changes

- **Response Format**: Changed userId to profileToken in verification responses
- **Request Format**: Profile completion now expects profileToken instead of userId

## Next Steps

Future improvements could include:

1. Setting correct CORS configurations
2. Adding JWE (encrypted tokens) for sensitive operations
3. Implementing refresh token rotation
4. Adding rate limiting middleware
