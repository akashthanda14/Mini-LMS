## üìã Required Actions

### 1. ‚úÖ Complete Account Recharge
- **Minimum:** ‚Çπ100 (approximately 400-600 SMS)
- **Dashboard:** https://www.fast2sms.com/dashboard
- **Navigation:** Dashboard ‚Üí Wallet ‚Üí Add Money

### 3. ‚úÖ Alternative: Use Quick Route (No Verification)
If you don't want to verify for OTP route, we can use Quick route for all messages.

---

## üîÑ Alternative Solution: Use Quick Route for OTPs

Instead of the OTP route, we can send OTPs using the Quick route:

### Update SMS Service

Edit `services/smsService.js` - Change the `sendOTP` function:

```javascript
// Send OTP using Quick route instead of OTP route
const response = await axios.post(
  FAST2SMS_API_URL,
  new URLSearchParams({
    message: `Your OTP is: ${otp}. Valid for 10 minutes. Do not share with anyone.`,
    language: 'english',
    route: 'q',  // Changed from 'otp' to 'q'
    numbers: cleanPhone,
  }),
  {
    headers: {
      'authorization': process.env.FAST2SMS_API_KEY,
      'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    },
  }
);
```

This requires:
- ‚úÖ Only ‚Çπ100 minimum recharge
- ‚ùå No website verification needed
- ‚úÖ Works immediately after recharge
